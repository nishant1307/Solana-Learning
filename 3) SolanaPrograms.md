Solana Program in its binary form is data inside a Solana Account. Every account in Solana is owned by a program, unlike Ethereum. The account holder is like an EOA that has access to private keys which can call the program, which controls the state of an account.

In Solana, accounts are charged rent inorder to exist on the Blockchain.
Since validators on the network need to maintain a working copy of this state in memory, the network charges a time-and-space based "rent" for this resource consumption.
