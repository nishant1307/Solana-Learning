Solana supports several types of wallets in the Solana native command-line app as well as wallets from third-parties.

For the majority of users, using one of the app wallets or a browser-based web wallet is recommended for better UX. 

Examples are:
1) https://solongwallet.com/
2) https://phantom.app/download
3) https://solflare.com/
4) https://www.sollet.io/ - Additional advantage is that Sollet allows you to mint test tokens on the Solana Devnet and Testnet directly as a button on the UI.

For developers, the command-line wallets may be more appropriate, as new features on the Solana blockchain will always be supported on the command line first before being integrated into third-party solutions.
